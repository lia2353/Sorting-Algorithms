    /*
        Bubble sort also known as Sinking sort.

        The algorithm works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The pass through
        the array is repeated until the array is sorted.

         * Time Complexity
            - Worst-case and Average complexity of O(N^2);
            - Best-case of O(N) , when an array is already sorted
         * Space Complexity O(1)
            - In-place algorithm
         * Stable algorithm
         * improvedSort version is Adaptive. If the array is partially sorted (no swaps were performed), we'll terminate
           the sorting early.

         * Number of Comparisons (Worst case) O(N^2)
            - every element is compared to every other element
         * Number of Swaps (Worst case) O(N^2)


          USE:
          - When the array is partially sorted - since bubble sort is adaptive
          - When we have memory usage constraints
          - When a simple sorting implementation is desired
          - When the array to be sorted is relatively small

          AVOID:
          - When the array-to-be-sorted has a large number of elements
          - When the array is completely  unsorted
          - When wanted a faster run time and memory is not a concern.
